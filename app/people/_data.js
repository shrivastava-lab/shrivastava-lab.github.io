    'I develop experimental & computational approaches to solve questions related to the microbiome, biofilms, collective motion, chemotaxis, molecular motors, and protein secretion. During my Postdoctoral training, I became interested in figuring out the factors that shape spatial structure of the human microbiota. We found that motile microbes of the phylum Bacteroidetes that are abundant in the human oral microbiome carry other non-motile bacteria as cargo and shape developing biofilms. Alongside, we also found a molecular rack and pinion machinery that couples with a bacterial Type 9 Secretion System (T9SS) and enables surface navigation.',
    'My lab at Arizona State University combines biology, physics, and computer science to answer curiosity-driven questions that are mostly related to the Microbiome and Microbial systems biology. Many recent reports show that changes in the human microbiome correlate with the occurrence of periodontal disease, oral and colorectal cancers, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aim to find why and how the microbiome correlates with the above diseases and how we can use this information to design therapeutic strategies. On the Microbial Systems Biology front, we are interested in finding the nuts and bolts of a molecular rack and pinion machinery, driven by the T9SS. Please check the research section of this website for detailed information.',
    'In spring, I teach a course titled Programming for Biologists. This course imparts a functional knowledge of Python. In fall, I teach a course titled Biology of microorganisms. Outside the lab, I enjoy tennis, cricket, volleyball, and random walks.'

          'I am passionate about understanding how bacteria regulate complex physiological traits, especially ones that determine association with hosts. My current research includes understanding the regulation and biophysics of T9SS-mediated gliding motility. I use tools ranging from bacterial genetics, protein biochemistry, microscopy and computational biology. Outside the lab, I like capturing stories on CMOS sensors.',

          'The wide array of microbial communities and the level of complexity to which such small organisms can achieve has always been a fascinating topic to me. During my undergraduate research career at Illinois State University, I focused on the metabolism taking place within Staphylococcal species. I have now transitioned into studying bacterial secretion system machinery, specifically the type  9 secretion system, that certain species utilize in order to carry out functions, like gliding motility. In my free time I enjoy doing puzzles, golfing, and enjoying the Arizona sun!',
